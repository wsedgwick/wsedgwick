### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am a drone technician specializing in wildlife survey design and machine learning. As a licensed commercial drone pilot, I consult with/provide expertise to non-profit organizations and government agencies to design and implement drone surveys for wildlife and habitat in Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Vietnam, and the United States. I am currently getting a Master in Environmental Data Science at the UC Santa Barbara Bren School to advance my machine learning and AI skills in wildlife conservation.
