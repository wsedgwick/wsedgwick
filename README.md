### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am a drone technician specializing in wildlife survey design. As a licensed commercial drone pilot, I consult with and provide expertise to non-profit organizations and government agencies to design and implement drone surveys for wildlife and habitat in Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Vietnam, and the United States. Last year I graduated with a Master's Degree in Environmental Data Science at the UC Santa Barbara Bren School, which provided a machine learning foundation from which I am currently learning object detection to count the individuals in the drone images I take.
